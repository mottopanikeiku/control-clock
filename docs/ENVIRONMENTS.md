# Batch environments

`control_clock/vector_env.py` implements NumPy batches of the **default**
CartPole-v1 and Acrobot-v1 environments from Gymnasium **1.2.1**. LunarLander-v3
uses a simple loop over independent `gymnasium.make` environments; Box2D physics
is not reimplemented. `GymnasiumBatch` also supplies the slow classic-control
reference in tests. Evaluation always uses Gymnasium, not the NumPy dynamics.

## Interface and episode handling

`make_vector(task, num_envs)` exposes `num_envs`, `observation_size`, and
`action_size`, plus:

- `reset(seeds)` takes a list containing one nonnegative Python integer per slot.
- `step(actions, active=None)` takes integer actions of shape `(num_envs,)` and
  returns `(observations, rewards, terminated, truncated)`. Observations have
  shape `(num_envs, observation_size)` and dtype `float32`; flags are boolean.
- `reset_done(mask, seeds)` takes a boolean mask of shape `(num_envs,)` and
  **one seed per selected slot**, in ascending slot-index order. It returns the
  full updated observation batch. Unselected state and elapsed counters are
  unchanged. An empty selection accepts `[]` and changes nothing. Selected
  slots need not already be done, allowing explicit episode restarts.
- `close()` releases Gymnasium environments and prevents subsequent use.

There is **no automatic reset**. The observation returned for a terminal or
truncated transition is the final observation, not the next episode's start.
Returned observation arrays are snapshots, so a subsequent partial reset does
not overwrite observations retained by a rollout buffer. Training must reset
finished slots separately. Stepping a finished active slot raises an error
rather than using Gymnasium's undefined post-termination behavior.

Policy search can supply a boolean `active` mask of shape `(num_envs,)`.
Inactive slots retain both their observations and elapsed counters, receive
reward zero and return false termination/truncation flags for that call. Their
previous done status is retained internally. This permits completed candidates
to wait while other candidates finish without advancing a terminated Box2D
world. Omitting the mask, or supplying all true, steps every slot.

Episode truncation is `elapsed_steps >= 500` for both classic tasks and
`elapsed_steps >= 1000` for LunarLander. Termination and truncation are
independent: both may be true on the same transition. Partial resets clear only
the selected counters and done status. Runtime validation rejects wrong action
shapes, noninteger/out-of-range actions, invalid mask shapes/dtypes and seed
lists with incorrect lengths or invalid elements.

## Numerical contract

Each classic-control reset draws four uniforms from a newly seeded
`np.random.default_rng(seed)`, matching Gymnasium's PCG64 generator. CartPole
uses reset bounds `[-0.05, 0.05]`, its default explicit Euler integrator and
float64 internal dynamics. Its default reward is one, including the transition
that terminates the episode.

Acrobot uses reset bounds `[-0.1, 0.1]`. An important upstream detail: Gymnasium
rounds **the initial internal state to float32**. This implementation retains
that rounding, then promotes the state to float64. Its reset observation also
uses float32 trigonometry, exactly as upstream; later observations are rounded
from float64 dynamics. Each action applies torque `-1`, `0` or `1`; the default
"book" equations use a single RK4 step of duration `0.2`. After integration,
angles are wrapped into inclusive `[-pi, pi]` (both endpoints are retained),
and velocities are clipped to `[-4*pi, 4*pi]` and `[-9*pi, 9*pi]`. Reward is
zero only when `-cos(theta1)-cos(theta1+theta2) > 1`, otherwise minus one.
The nondefault NIPS equations, torque noise and custom reset bounds are not
supported by this API. LunarLander preserves Box2D's native internal precision;
the float64 internal-dynamics guarantee applies only to NumPy classic control.

The fixed observation and internal-state comparison is `numpy.testing.assert_allclose` with
**`atol=2e-6`, `rtol=2e-7`**. This permits float32 output rounding and small
scalar-versus-array ufunc differences without feeding rounded observations
back into the integrator. The maximum permitted discrepancy is
`2e-6 + 2e-7 * abs(reference_value)`; at Acrobot's largest velocity it is
under `8e-6`. Rewards, termination and truncation flags are compared **exactly**;
there is no tolerance for decisions or episode lengths.

`tests/test_equivalence.py` compares every observation and the four internal
state coordinates across seeded random classic sequences, as well as
independently reset slots, masked execution and the Gymnasium batch
fallback. It also exercises CartPole failure thresholds, Acrobot wrapping and
velocity clipping, terminal rewards, full 500-step classic time limits, the
1,000-step Lunar limit boundary and coincident termination/truncation. Boundary
fixtures directly set matching internal reference states; the full time-limit
test holds state near the task's starting equilibrium without resetting its
elapsed counter, to isolate truncation from failure dynamics. Every dynamics
implementation is checked against upstream rather than a duplicated local
set of equations. Run the equivalence tests with:
`uv run pytest tests/test_equivalence.py`.

## Gymnax training in the extra GPU comparison

The GPU PPO uses installed **Gymnax 0.0.9** for training only.
[`test_jax.py`](../tests/test_jax.py) checks fixed internal states against
Gymnasium 1.2.1: 100 states per task, every discrete action, exact rewards and
done decisions away from time limits, and observations within
`atol=2e-5, rtol=2e-5`. It also checks reset ranges, the 500-step limit,
CartPole's strict position threshold, terminal rewards and Acrobot's angle
wrapping endpoint. These are local transition comparisons, not bitwise
trajectory equivalence or a guarantee about arbitrarily close boundaries.

The default physics match: CartPole's Euler update, masses, gravity, timestep,
force, angle/position limits and one-point terminal reward; Acrobot's book
equations, torque choices, one RK4 step at 0.2, velocity clipping,
height threshold and zero reward on a successful terminal transition.
The training maximum episode length remains 500 for both tasks. Every
qualification evaluation still uses actual Gymnasium, so its threshold,
episode semantics and reset distribution—not Gymnax's training return—decide
whether a policy passes.

There are real differences:

- Gymnax computes internal dynamics in float32 here; Gymnasium mostly uses
  float64 internally. Repeated trajectories can diverge.
- Gymnax draws resets with JAX's PRNG, not NumPy's PCG64. Uniform ranges match,
  but identical seed integers do not produce the same initial states.
- Gymnax's `step` automatically resets completed slots on the same step and
  returns one `done` flag for termination or time limit. The GPU GAE treats
  both as terminal, with no timeout bootstrap.
- Gymnax wraps Acrobot angles into `[-pi, pi)` while Gymnasium retains either
  endpoint of `[-pi, pi]`. At exactly `+pi`, their internal angles differ
  by a full rotation; their sine/cosine observations represent the same
  physical position up to floating-point rounding.
- Both libraries define useful rewards only through episode completion;
  I do not compare stepping a previously completed state without resetting it.
